## Challenges

The instructions for setting up the files was very confusing and it was difficult to submit the proper items. I completed the challenge, but I do not believe the proper format is turned with the combination of the code. It could be helpful to incorporate these steps throughout rather than only providing instructions for how the assignment should be submitted at the very top.
